# Medicare-fraud

1. Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information related to Medicare fraud and is used for fraud detection purposes. It includes various attributes such as beneficiary ID (BeneID), age, membership months for Part A and Part B, gender, and flags indicating the presence of specific medical conditions. The dataset also includes reimbursement and deductible amounts, as well as a target variable indicating the presence of fraud.

2. Clustering Method and Environment:
K-means clustering was applied to this dataset using PySpark on Databricks. PySpark is a Python library that enables distributed data processing using Apache Spark. Databricks provides a cloud-based platform for big data processing and analytics. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into distinct clusters based on similarity.

3. Clustering Features:
The features used for clustering include beneficiary age, membership months for Part A and Part B, gender, and flags indicating the presence of various medical conditions. These features were selected to capture important aspects of beneficiaries' profiles and aid in identifying patterns or clusters.

4. Purpose and Outcome:
The purpose of applying k-means clustering to this dataset using PySpark on Databricks is to identify clusters of beneficiaries with similar characteristics. By grouping beneficiaries together based on their attributes, potential patterns and similarities can be discovered. This analysis can assist in detecting anomalous or fraudulent behavior within the Medicare system and contribute to the development of targeted fraud prevention strategies.
